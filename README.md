# DataDev
James Estes - Programming and Database Development
I am a senior in high school and I am wanting to become a cyber security analyst/researcher at Google.

Jacob Smith - Images and Database Layout



We had wanted to design the art on the site ourselves and dedicated the first several days to image development. After that, I (James) had started on the backend development of the site while Jacob had continued image development. I had written some code a long time ago that allowed users to make accounts and log into it and i decided to implement this code. The hardest thing for the programming was when I spent several days troubleshooting why PHP was not echoing data from an associative array gathered from a sql query. It turns out that '' means an integer value and that is what is expected. We had created most images for use on the design of the site.
